I am currently a senior undergraduate student from Tsinghua University major in mathematics and applied mathematics.
I am currently interested in reinforcement learning and robustness, both from theoretical and empirical aspect. I hope to design algorithms that are not only practical but also with strong theoretical guarantee. I am very fortunate to work with Professor [Pan Xu](https://panxulab.github.io/) and [Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html).
