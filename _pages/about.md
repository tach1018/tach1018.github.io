I am currently a senior undergraduate student from Tsinghua University major in mathematics and applied mathematics.
I am currently interested in **reinforcement learning** and **robustness**, both from theoretical and empirical aspect. I hope to design algorithms that are not only practical but also with strong theoretical guarantee. I am very fortunate to work with Professor [Pan Xu](https://panxulab.github.io/) in Duke university. 

In this summer, I was honored to visit Carnegie Mellon University as a research intern in Safe AI lab, advised by Professor [Ding Zhao](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/zhao-ding.html). See my recent [report](../files/Policy-regularized%20Offfine%20Safe%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20with%20Preference.pdf) about offline safe RL done in CMU! Now I am working on my graduation thesis
with Professor [Longbo Huang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/) in Tsinghua University.
